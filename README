NAME
    Acme::Terror::AU - Fetch the current AU terror alert level

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Terror::AU;
      my $t = Acme::Terror::AU->new();  # create new Acme::Terror::AU object

      my $level = $t->fetch;
      print "Current terror alert level is: $level\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Gets the currrent terrorist threat level in Australia.

    The levels are either...

     CRITICAL    - an attack is expected imminently 
     SEVERE      - an attack is likely
     SUBSTANTIAL - an attack is a strong possibility
     MODERATE    - an attack is possible but not likely
     LOW         - an attack is unlikely
     UNKNOWN     - cannot determine threat level

    HOWEVER, as the government has repeatedly stated that they think
    triggering various security events off a single level system would be
    damage flexibiliy by oversimplifying the situation, and in any case, why
    on earth should they let the terrorists see what their alert status is.

    And so this module never returns any of the above status, and instead
    always returns UNKNOWN. :)

    This module aims to be compatible with the US version Acme::Terror and
    the UK version Acme::Terror::UK.

METHODS
  new()
      use Acme::Terror::AU
      my $t = Acme::Terror::AU->new(); 

    Create a new instance of the Acme::Terror::AU class.

  fetch()
      my $threat_level_string = $t->fetch();
      print $threat_level_string;

    Return the current threat level as a string.

  level()
      my $level = $t->level();
      if ($level == Acme::Terror::AU::CRITICAL) {
        print "Help, we're all going to die!\n";
      }

    Return the level of the current terrorist threat as a comparable value.

    The values to compare against are,

      Acme::Terror::AU::CRITICAL
      Acme::Terror::AU::SEVERE
      Acme::Terror::AU::SUBSTANTIAL
      Acme::Terror::AU::MODERATE
      Acme::Terror::AU::LOW

    If it can't retrieve the current level, it will return

      Acme::Terror::AU::UNKNOWN

BUGS
    This module may become buggy if Australia develops a simple public and
    level-based terror alert system, like the ones the US and UK have.
